## 1.0 Objectives

The objective of this work is to build and support an ecosystem for magma training and certification. 


## 2.0 Background

Currently Magma certification is not maintained by anone and there are a lot of bugs in the platform like after completion of the test certificate should be generated automatically. Instead of this, the user has to request the admin to generate the certificate after passing the test.

## 3.0 Implementation scope
## 3.1

We have developed an end to end platform based on Openedx. This platform includes Blockchain based certificates powered by Hyperledger Besu.

## POC:

[Link](https://edx.magmaindia.org/)

We will finalize the changes according to magma core foundation once our proposal will be approved by the foundation.

We will also build an app for the same

## 3.2 

In future we will add Microsite so that anyone from the magma community can make their own MOOCS on magma and can host it on our platform.
